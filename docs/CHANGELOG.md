## Architecture Decision

### Why Local Storage First?
1. **Simplicity:** Faster development and testing
2. **No Dependencies:** Works without external services
3. **Offline-First:** Core functionality works without internet
4. **Cost-Effective:** No cloud storage costs during development
5. **Gradual Migration:** Easy to add S3 later without breaking changes

### Future S3 Integration Plan
1. Maintain current local storage as fallback
2. Add S3 upload as primary method
3. Background sync for pending uploads
4. Hybrid approach for maximum reliability
